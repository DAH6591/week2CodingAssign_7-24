            <!--additional header and p element selectors and img id selector within the button id-->
            <p>I am an active individual living near the Rocky Mountains. I'm semi-retired (not by chioce) and have
                decided to pursue a career<br> entirely new to me. I previously worked as a scientist. I have a degree
                in Geology and a graduate degree in Environmental Science.<br>
                I enjoy outside activities and sports. I love being in the mountains. See the table below, which
                highlights some favorite things in my life.
